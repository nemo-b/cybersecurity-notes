COURSE LEARNINGS:

- C.I.S.S.P.’s eight security domains
- Security frameworks and controls
- Security audits
- Basic security tools
- Protecting assets and data

**Mitigate**: To make a problem or threat less bad or harmful. In cybersecurity, it means taking steps to reduce the impact of security issues and make them less damaging.

**Shared responsibility**: All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering and maintaining both physical and virtual security

This is a continuation from the previous page

1. Identity and access management
2. Security assessment and testing
3. Security operations
4. Software development security

First, we discuss Identity and access management.

**Identity and access management (I.A.M.)**: Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets

This limits workers in other departments to information that they need, nothing more. This is to reduce the chance of risk if something happens.

Components of IAM

1. Identification
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Accountability

Second, we discuss Security assessment and testing.

**Security assessment and testing**: Focused on conducting security control and testing, collecting and analyzing data and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities

This helps companies mitigate risks, threats and vulnerabilities

One good example of security assessment would be starting to enforce a multifactor authentication for company property and accounts.

Third, we discuss Security operations.

**Security operations**: Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures

Investigations begin when a threat has been identified. In an active attack, mitigating an attack is essential to preventing the loss of private information. Afterward, a D**igital Forensics Investigation** will happen to find out when, how, why the breach occurred. This is well-used for finding flaws in protection and securing the issue.

Lastly, we discuss Software development security.

**Software development security**: Focused on using secure coding practices

Secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to secure applications and services

“For example, performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and testing phases, and penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase, insures that security is embedded into the software product at every step.”

**END OF SECTION**

As an entry level security analyst, one of the roles that could be given is to handle digital and physical assets such as office spaces computers customers P.I.I. intellectual properties, such as patents or copyrighted data.

**Social engineering**: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables

One example of social engineering would be phishing, as explained before.

**Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset; the likelihood of a threat occurring

Risks are rated at different levels depending on the possible threats  and value of the asset 

**Low-risk asset**: Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations and would not cause financial damage if compromised

**Medium-risk asset**: Information that is not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations

**High-risk asset**: Information protected by regulations or laws which is compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation

**Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

(Both a vulnerability and a threat need to exist for a risk to show)

Some ways you can help people realize the importance of security would be teaching people about phishing, or start using access cards to reach areas that are important and keeping visitors out.

**Ransomware**: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access

**NIST Risk management framework (R.M.F.) “[nist.gov/rmf](http://nist.gov/rmf)” -** 

**RMF Step One**: Prepare

Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs

**RMF Step Two**: Categorize

Used to develop risk management processes and tasks

**RMF Step Three**: Select

Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization

**RMF Step Four**: Implement

Implement security and privacy plans for the organization

**RMF Step Five**: Assess

Determine if established controls are implemented correctly

**RMF Step Six**: Authorize

Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization

**RMF Step Seven**: Monitor

Be aware of how systems are operating

**Security frameworks**: guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

**Security controls**: Specific controls designed to reduce specific security risks

**Encryption**: The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format

**Authentication**: The process of verifying who someone or something is

Using a username and password is the most basic form of authentication. Multifactor authentication (M.F.A.), is a more secure form of authentication which asks for more information, such as a code or **biometrics**.

B**iometrics**: Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity

**Vishing**: The exploration of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

**NIST Cybersecurity framework (CSF)**: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guide lands, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

**NIST S.P. 800-53**: A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government

NIST CSF focuses on these core functions

1. Identify: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets
2. Protect: the strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools, that help mitigate cybersecurity steps
3. Detect: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
4. Respond: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process
5. Recover: The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation

Open Web Applications Security(O.W.A.S.) Principles; Some useful O.W.A.S. Principles for starting security analysts…

1. Minimize attack surface area
2. Principle of the least privilege (Only share what's necessary)
3. Defense in depth
4. Separation of duties
5. Keep security simple
6. Fix security issues correctly

**Security audit**: A systematic examination of an organization's information systems, infrastructure, policies, and procedures to assess their compliance with established security standards, policies, and best practices.

Common elements of internal audits

1. Establishing the scope and goals
2. Conducting a risk assessment
3. Completing a controls assignment
4. Assessing compliance
5. Communicating results

**Risk Description - there is a lack of proper management of physical and digital assets; equipment used to store data is not properly secured; and access to private information in the organization's internal network needs robust controls in place.**

Here are some examples of audit questions

- What is the audit meant to achieve?
- Which assets are most at risk?
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
- What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

**Control categories**

1. Administrative controls: The physical, in person control of cybersecurity, like setting password policies
2. Technical controls: hardware and software solutions to protect assets, like I.D.S. and encrypting
3. Physical controls: Measures put in place to prevent physical access to protected assets, like surveillance cameras and locks

**REMINDER (**Log**: A record of events that occur within an organization’s systems)*

Common log sources

1. **Firewall log**: A record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests from the internet from withing the network.
2. **Network log**: A record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.
3. **Server logs**: A record of events related to services, such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

Here is an example of what a security analyst would see while on duty.

**Scope**: The internal IT audit will assess the following:

- Assess user permissions
- Identify existing controls, policies, and procedures
- Account for technology currently in use

**Goals**: The goals for the internal IT audit are:

- Adhere to the N.I.S.T. Cybersecurity Framework (C.S.F.)
- Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations
- Fortify system controls

**Design principles:** are fundamental guidelines and concepts that inform the creation and development of effective and well-thought-out designs across various disciplines

**REMINDER (**Security Information and Event Management (S.E.I.M.) tool**: An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization)*

**Metrics**: key technical attributes, such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.

Different types of S.E.I.M. Tools

- Self-hosted:
- Cloud-Hosted:

**Splunk Enterprise**: A self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization’s log data to provide security information and alerts in real-time

**Splunk Cloud**: A could-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data

**Chronicle**: A cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data

**Playbook**: A manual that provides detail about any operational action

One nice thing to keep in mind is that playbooks will be frequently updated depending on updated  information or the seriousness of an incident.

**Incident response**: An organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach

**Incident response playbook phases**

1. **Preparation** - This phase is done by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users.
2. **Detection and analysis** - This phase helps a security analyst determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.
3. **Containment** - This phase is used to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident.
4. **Eradication and recovery** - This phase is used to completely remove an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations. This is done by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerability. Once the artifacts are disposed, they can start retrieving lost data due to the incident. (**I.T. restoration**)
5. **Post incident activity** - This phase is used in documenting the incident, informing organization's leadership, and applying lessons learned to make sure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents. (This step could be altered depending on the seriousness of the incident).
6. **Coordination** - This phase involves reporting incidents and sharing information throughout the incident response process based on the organization's established standards.
