# Google Cybersecurity Certificate Notes 🛡️

These are my personal notes while working through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** program.  
At first, I started by summarizing the material presented in the course videos, but over time I added my own explanations, examples, and insights to make the notes more useful for review and retention.

This course I beleive was a great way to **begin** my path from general computer science knowledge into cybersecuity knowledge. I did all of my studying on the official Google Career certificate channel on youtube, and when I beleived I was ready, I went to Coursera and went through the course and got the certificate. I will provide the links to the Official Youtube playlist s well as the coursera course for the certificate below.

## 🚀 Why Share These?
I’m sharing these notes because:  
- Writing things down helps me **understand more deeply**, and putting them here keeps me accountable.  
- I want to **look back later** and see how my notes (and my understanding) have grown.  
- If these notes help even one other person who’s learning cybersecurity, then it’s worth it.
