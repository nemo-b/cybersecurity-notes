This is a job that won't die off and will positively grow over time.

Personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) is any information used to infer and individual's identity.

Sensitive Personally identifiable information (S.P.I.I.) is a specific type of P.I.I. that falls under stricter handling guidelines.

Someone's P.I.I. or S.P.I.I. data are key assets that a key actor will target for possible identity fraud and identity theft, which eventually leads to financial gain.

**Computer Virus**: malicious code written to interfere with operations and cause damage to data and software

**Malware**: Software designed to harm devices or networks

**Threat actors**: Individuals or groups that intentionally cause harm to digital devices or systems. Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and software to perpetuate a variety of cyberattacks.

**Phishing**: the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. Ex: Love letter scam of 2000

Computer emergency response teams (C.E.R.T.S.) - Groups of experts responsible for the protection against, detection of, and response to an attack on an organization's information system.

One notable information breach was the Equifax breach, during the breach over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all Americans. The records included social security numbers birthdates, driver's license numbers, home addresses, and credit card numbers. 

(C.I.S.S.P.), this defines eight domains. 

1. **Security and risk management**: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
2. **Asset security**: Focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention and destruction of data.
3. **Security architecture and engineering**: Focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring that effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
4. **Communication and network security**: Focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
5. Identity and access management
6. Security assessment and testing
7. Security operations
8. Software development security

**Firewall**: This is used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.

**When trying to assess security alerts as a security analyst, first you would start by identifying your organization's critical assets and risks, then you would start implementing additional security measure to keep alerts from becoming serious incidents.** 

**Security frameworks**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

**The Purpose of security frameworks**

1. Protecting P.I.I.
2. Securing financial information
3. Identifying security information
4. Managing organizational risks
5. Aligning security with business goals

General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.): A European law for giving more user control over their own personal information.

**Components of security frameworks**

1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing security processes
4. Monitoring and communication results

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C.I.A.)

**C.I.A. triad**: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data

**Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable

**Availability**: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it

**Asset**: An item perceived as having value to and organization

**Security ethics**: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

**SQL** is most likely the most useful coding language that is helpful for jobs regarding the cybersecurity field.

**Log**: A record of events that occur within an organizationâ€™s systems

**Security Information and Event Management (S.E.I.M.) tool**: An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization

**Splunk** and **Google Chronicle** are the most commonly used S.E.I.M. tools

**Playbook**: A manual that provides details about and operation action

**Network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer)**: A tool designed to  capture and analyze data traffic within a network

**Programming**: Used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks

**Linux**: An open source operating system

**Structured Query Language (SQL)**: A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database

**Database**: An organized collection of information or data

**Python**: Used to preform task that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy
