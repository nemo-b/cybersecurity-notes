## **Security Policies - CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 - 5.1**

### Security policy guidelines

- What policies are you following to provide CIA?
    - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
- High level strategies like data storage requirements and security event procedures
- Detailed security goals
    - This includes appropriate Wi-Fi usage, requirements for remote access
- Security policies answer the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù
    - Technical security controls, the ‚Äúhow‚Äù

### Information security policies

- The big list of all security related policies
- Includes compliance requirements, which can be critical to an organization
- Detailed security procedures that determine what should be done when something happens

Acceptable use policies (AUP)

- This is exactly what it says, it is a policy that determines what the acceptable use of company assets is
- They cover many topics
    - Internet use, telephones, computers, mobile devices, etc
- Used by an organization to limit legal liability
    - If someone is dismissed, these are the well-documented reasons why

### Business continuity

- Not everything goes to plan, so always plan for situations that are outside the norm
    - This could be things like the loss of computers or other common technologies
- There need to be an alternative
    - Manual transactions
    - Paper receipts
    - Phone calls for transaction approvals
- There must also be documentation of the problems, and also documentation and testing of the fallbacks before the problem occurs
    - You can't rely on something that exists, but doesn't work

Disaster recovery plan

- If there is a disaster, IT should be ready
    - Part of the business continuity planning
    - Keep the organization up and running
- Disasters are many and varied
    - Natural disasters
    - Technology or system
    - Human created disasters
- A comprehensive plan has the following‚Ä¶
    - Recovery location
    - Data recovery method

    - Keep the process on schedule
    - Stay in budget
- There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbest way‚Äù
    - But it helps to have a framework
    - There are many options

![Here's an example of popular SDLCs. The one on the right is meant to be‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ agile. Quick and easy and meant for less serious issue. The waterfall method is used for more intricate issues as a slow method to do things. It is used in a way so the step NIST SP00-61 of solving a security issue can be broken into easier to follow steps, which greatly helps in following guides like the one given by NIST.](Screenshot_From_2025-06-25_12-11-40.png)

    - Company aquistition, new equipment instalation, unique new security threats, etc.
- Continuous assesments
    - May be apart of an existing process
    - Change control requires a risk assesment as part of the change

### Ad hoc assesments

- An orginization may not have a formal risk assesment process
    - Perform a risk assesment when the situation requires
- EX: CEO is back from a confrence and wants to know if the orginization is protected from a new attack type

### Recurring assesments

- Eveluation occors on standard intervals

### Quantitative risk assesment

- ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)
    - How likely is it that a hurricane will hit? In Montana? In Florida?
- Asset value (AV)
    - The value of the asset to the orginization
    - Includes the cost of the asset, the effct on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
    - What is the monetary loss if a single event occors?
    - Asset value (AV) x Exposure factor (EF)
    - Laptop stoen = $1,000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)

### Likelihood and probability

    - This is often the usual course
- Accept with exemption
    - A security policy or regulation cannot be followed
    - May be based on avalible security controls, size of the orginization, total assets, etc.
    - Exemption may need approval
- Accept with exception
    - Internal security policies are not applied
    - Monthly security updates must be applied within 3 clender days
    - The monthly updates cause a critical software package to crash
    - An exception is made to update timeframe
- Avoid
    - Stop participating in high-risk activities
    - This effecttivly removes the risk
- Mitigate
    - Decrease the risk level
    - Invest in security systems

- Recovery point objective (RPO)
    - How much data loss is acceptable?
    - Bring the system back online; how far back does the system go?
    - If the database is up, but only provides the last 12 months of data
- Mean time to repair (MTTR)
    - Average time required to fix an issue
    - This includes time spent diagnosing the problem
    - An important metric for determining the cost and time associated with unplanned outages

### Anomalous behavior recognition

- Risky behavious
    - Modifying hosts file
    - Replacing a core OS file
    - Uploading sensitive files
- Unexpected behavior
    - Logon from another country
    - Increase in data transfers
- Unintentional behavior
    - Typing the wrong domain name
    - Misplacing USB Drives
    - Misconfiguring security settings

### Reporting and monitoring

- Track and analyze security awareness metrics
    - Automated
    - Phishing click rates
    - Password manager adoption, MFA use, password sharing
- Initial
    - First occorence is an opportunity for user training
    - Work towards avoiding the issue in the future
- Recurring
    - The value of long term-monitoring
    - Identify high-frequency security issues
    - Help users with multiple occorrences

### Development

- Create a Security Awareness team
    - Determine roles for training, monitoring, policy creation, etc.
- Esablish a minimum awareness level
    - Information delivery (emails, posters, notices, training)
    - Depth of training based on job function
- Integrate compliance mandates
    - PCI DSS, HIPPA, GDPR, etc.
- Define metrics
    - Assess the performance of security awareness programs
    - Make updates in lower-performing areas

### Execution

- Create the training materials
    - Provided to users in different forms
- Document success measurements
    - How will we know the awareness is working?
- Identify the stakeholders
    - Provide ongoing metrics and performance data
- Deploy the training materials
    - Classroom training, posters, weekly emails, etc.
- Track user training efforts
    - Ongoing monitoring, usually wit an automated reporting system

- Before providing access, train your users
    - Detailed security requirements
- Specialized training
    - Each user role has unique security responsibilities
- Also applies to third-parties
    - Contractors, partners, suppliers
- Detailed documentation and records
    - Problems later can be serve for everyone

### User guidence and training

- **Policy/handbook**
    - document all security requirements
    - Provide access online in policy guidelines
    - Refrence the policies in the employee handbook
- **Situational awareness**
    - Users should always be looking for threats
    - Software attacks: Email links, attachments, unusual URLs, text messages, etc.
    - Physical attacks: USB drives in a FedEx envelope, unlocked building doors, etc.
    - Be ready for anything
- **Insider threat**
    - Difficult to gaurd agianst
    - Add multiple approvals for critical processes
    - Monitor files and systems as much as possible
    - It should be very difficult to make an unauthorized change
- **Password management**
    - Many standards to choose from
    - Guide users with standard requirements (length, complexity, etc.)
    - his is often controlled using technology (Group policy)
- **Removable media and cables**
    - Unknown USB drives can contain malware
    - Unknown cables can be malicious
- **Social engineering**
    - Extensive and ongoing training
    - The attackers are very good
    - The users are your front line of defense
- **Operational security**
    - View security from the attacker‚Äôs perspective
    - Users need to identify sensitive data
    - Keep the sensitive data private
- **Hybrid/remote work enviornments**
    - Working from home brings unusual security risks
    - No access to family and friends
    - Additional endpoint security
    - Security policies for VPN access
