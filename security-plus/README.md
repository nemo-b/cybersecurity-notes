# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Notes

This repository is a collection of my notes primarily from Professor Messers youtube series on the Security+ SY0-701 Test. 

For credit, here is the playlist which I HIGHLY recomend for studying.

It starts with raw study notes and grows into hands-on labs, projects, and reflections.  
Think of it as a personal learning log — hopefully good for anyone who might find it useful.

## 🚀 Why Share These?
I didn’t start these notes expecting to publish them — at first, they were just a way to keep track of what I was studying.  
Over time, though, they became more personal: I added my own summaries, examples, and thoughts instead of just copying from sources.  

I’m sharing them because:  
- Writing things down helps me **understand more deeply**, and putting them here keeps me accountable.  
- I want to **look back later** and see how my notes (and my understanding) have grown.  
- If these notes help even one other person who’s learning cybersecurity, then it’s worth it.
