# Cyber Labs 🛡️

Welcome to my **Cyber Labs** repository!  

This repo is where I’ll explore hands-on cybersecurity labs, exercises, and experiments as I move through courses, certifications, and my own home projects.  

Right now, my top priority is studying, but once I’ve tackled my short-term goals and tests, I’ll start gathering and setting up all the tools I need for these labs.  

One plan I have for this space is to create a **checklist of as many security tools as I can get my hands on**, along with notes on what I learned from each. I also want to include little reflections, specific examples, and “aha!” moments — the kind of stuff that really sticks when you’re learning by doing.  

Think of this repo as a mix of structured learning, personal experiments, and a place where I can track my growth — like a lab notebook, doubling as a portfolio.

## 📂 What to Expect... hopefully soon
- Practice environments and lab setups for learning cybersecurity skills.  
- Exercises covering network security, system administration, and incident response.  
- Small scripts or tools I build to automate security tasks.  
- Detailed writeups documenting each lab, including goals, tools used, and lessons learned.  

> Currently a placeholder — I’ll be adding content as I complete labs and projects.

## 🚀 Why This Repo
I’m creating this repo to:  
- Track my **hands-on learning** and growth over time.  
- Build a **portfolio of practical skills** to share with recruiters, mentors, or anyone interested.  
- Provide detailed documentation so I (and others) can replicate or learn from the labs.
